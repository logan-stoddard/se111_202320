                    <h3><b>Logan Stoddard</b><em> 2/4/2023</em></h3>

                    <p>My thoughts on the <em>Matrix</em> is that it is a great movie and brings
                    many diffent points within it the story itself is fun to follow. I like the concept of the world we live
                    in is not real and all we see is a simulation. My personal favorite character
                    wold be the Orical, one of the best scenes in the movie is when there is the room of 
                    gifted children. Neo talks to one of these kid who can bend spoons with her mind
                    she gives good wisdom to Neo about how the brain works. <em>The Matrix</em> is full of these little
                    parts and it is what makes it a great movie. If you have not seen it already I highly recomend you watch it.</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>The opening action scene took six months of training and four days to shoot.</li>
                        <li>According to costume designer Kym Barrett, Trinity's costume was made with cheap PVC because of the much tighter budget. Similarly, Neo's coat wasn't actually a very expensive fabric. It was a wool blend purchased for $3 a yard.</li>
                        <li>The studio insisted on a great deal of explanatory dialogue, as they described the screenplay as "the script that nobody understands."</li>
