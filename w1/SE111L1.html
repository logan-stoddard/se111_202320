        <p>This is a bio about myself I don't really know what to write about so... Im just gonna keep on typing, my favorite color
            is orange but I also really like purple. Some hobbies I do are ATV's my dad and I go out to places and do expert level trails.
            I find it pretty fun and enjoy doing it, another thing about myself is I play guitar ive been play for a little over six years.
            Im quite fond of music and I enjoy anything music related for example I colect records. Im starting to run out of things to say so
            I guess I will end my Bio here thanks for reading. :)
